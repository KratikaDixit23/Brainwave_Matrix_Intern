# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on developing a fraud detection model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised learning techniques suitable for imbalanced data.

## Project Overview

The Credit Card Fraud Detection project includes the following key components:

- **Data Analysis:** Understanding and exploring the dataset to find patterns and insights.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating and selecting important features that help in improving the model's performance.
- **Model Training:** Using machine learning algorithms to build a robust model for detecting fraud.

Usage
Data Analysis:

The data_analysis.ipynb notebook contains steps for loading and analyzing the data to understand its structure and distribution.
Feature Engineering:

The feature_engineering.py script implements various techniques to create and select features that enhance model performance.
Model Training:

The model_training.ipynb notebook details the training process of the models.
The project uses two models:
Logistic Regression, achieving an accuracy of 97.01%.
Decision Tree Classifier, achieving an accuracy of 99.84%.
The trained models are saved for future predictions.
Results
Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy of 97.01%.
Decision Tree Classifier: Achieved an accuracy of 99.84%.
