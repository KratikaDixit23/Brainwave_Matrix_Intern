Project Overview:-
The Fake News Detection project includes the following key components:

Text Cleaning: Utilizing NLTK and Spacy libraries to preprocess the text data.
Feature Extraction: Implementing the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm to extract significant features from the text.
Model Training: Training a Linear SVC (Support Vector Classifier) model which achieved an impressive accuracy of 99.3291%.
